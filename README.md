# Hey, I'm Michael.

I'm currently an undergraduate Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of York, U.K., and part of the [@UniversityRadioYork](https://www.github.com/UniversityRadioYork) Computing team, developing and maintaing our systems to allow people to host and present radio shows. 

- Primarily interested in back-end code and system software, with system administration experience,
- Proficient in Go, Python and Java, and comfortable in basic web-development tools,
- Currently working to improve in C/C++ and Kotlin.
 
##### Extra Bits

- Scared of snakes despite liking Python
- Never realised as a kid that "readme" literally spelt "read me". I thought it was some weird file name for something you shouldn't touch. I also never realised as a kid that "mailto" was "mail to". Read it as "malito" for a very long time, and thought that was some 80's e-mail technical phrase.
- Can quit Vim.
